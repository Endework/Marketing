# Marketing Analytics Dashboard: Monitoring and Evaluating Ads Efficiency

## Business Objective
The aim of this project is to track the efficiency of the marketing strategy and identify areas for improvement. To achieve this, I will follow these steps:

1. **Collect Bank Advertisements from Tikvah-Ethiopia Channel**:
   - Gather data on bank advertisements from the Tikvah-Ethiopia channel.
   - Store this data in a PostgreSQL data warehouse.

2. **Demonstrate Conversion Tracking**:
   - Choose at least one bank (e.g., Abyssinia Bank) to demonstrate conversion tracking.
   - Collect data on Android app reviews and download counts (daily and monthly) from the Play Store.
   - Obtain telegram subscription data for the main bank channel.

3. **Set Up a Dashboard System**:
   - Connect the data warehouse to a dashboard system.
   - Ensure that plots and figures are dynamically updated as more data is added.

4. **Analyze Data and Produce Dashboards**:
   - Answer key marketing efficiency questions:
     - How do different bank advertisements in Tikvah perform in terms of view count per post?
     - How are app downloads influenced by advertisements?
     - How are telegram channel subscriptions influenced by Tikvah advertisements?

5. **Choose a Dashboard Platform**:
   - Review open-source and proprietary dashboard systems.
   - Consider Looker Studio, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Redash, Superset, and Metabase.
   - Evaluate pros and cons based on relevant metrics.
   - Select a suitable platform and deliver the first draft of the solution within one week.
