It's not always working with network error, even though the network is good on my phone. 2. It happened to me several times that when I transfer money to someone's account, I doubled the transfer! Or in another word, my money sent two times. If I wanted to send 10,000, I found that sent 20,000 because of the APP error. I hope this will be fixed soon.",
