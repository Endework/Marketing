I've updated the App. when it needed but nothing changed. ðŸ‘‰PLEASE if it has some issues with the App. Please fix it otherwise I'm going to uninstall it.","2","BOA"

We can't send money or even be able to check our account. They even take it down from the Play Store for a while. This whole process usually takes them 3 to 5 days. This is very disappointing. It is an improvement from the previous version of the app, but they still have a long way to go to compete with the likes of CBE. Transferring to other banks sometimes doesn't work.","2","BOA"
